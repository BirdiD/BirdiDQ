- **[Great Expectations](https://github.com/Soulter/hugging-chat-api)**
- **Finetuned LLMs**:
    - **[Falcon-7B parameters causal decoder-only model](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b)**: The model is finetuned on custom data with **Qlora** approach.
    - **[OpenAI GPT-3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)**: Also finetuned on the same data
